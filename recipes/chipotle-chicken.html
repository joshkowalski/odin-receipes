    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 and 1/2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cumin</li>
      <li>1 can (7oz) chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To a medium bowl, add the coriander, cumin, chipotle peppers in adobo,
        garlic, kosher salt, and olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken thighs to a zippered plastic bag and pour the chipotle
        mixture over the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shake the bag to coat all of the chicken. Remove any excess air and zip
        shut.
      </li>
      <li>Place in the refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        When ready, add the chicken thighs to a large skillet over medium-high
        heat. Cook the thighs on each side for 3-5 minutes, or until slightly
        charred. Switch heat to medium-low and continue cooking (about 10-15
        minutes) until the internal temperature is 165Â°F.
      </li>
      <li>Dice the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
      <li>
        Serve with tortillas, rice, fresh pico, sour cream, cheese, and all of
        your other favorite fixings (i.e., lettuce, guacamole, caramelized
        onions).
      </li>
    </ol>
